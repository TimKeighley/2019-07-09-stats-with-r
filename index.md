# Statistics with R

## Welcome

Welcome to the Statistics with R workshop held at Macquarie University. This workshop will be held on the 9th, 10th and 16th of July.

**Who:** The course is aimed at graduate students and other researchers who are interested in learning about how to do statistics in R.
**You are expected to have previous experience with R.** This is not an introductory R course.

**Where:** Room 149, 7 Wally's Walk, Macquarie University.

**When:** 9, 10, 16 July 2019.

**Requirements:** Participants must bring a laptop with a Mac, Linux, or Windows operating system (not a tablet, Chromebook, etc.)
that they have administrative privileges on. They should have a few specific software packages installed
([listed below](#software-requirements)).

**Accessibility:** We are committed to making this workshop accessible to everybody. The workshop organizers have checked that:

- The room is wheelchair / scooter accessible.
- Accessible restrooms are available.

Materials will be provided in advance of the workshop and large-print handouts are available if needed by notifying the organizers
in advance. If we can help making learning easier for you (e.g. sign-language interpreters, lactation facilities) please get in touch
(using contact details below) and we will attempt to provide them.
